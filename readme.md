# Training: Model a Game with OOP

You've learned about OOP, but let's look at how to **incorporate object oriented programming patterns into a web site**.  This document has an example of how we might approach making a card-matching memory game.

### User Stories & Game Mechanics
1. A user will be able to see a set of face-down cards.
2. A user will be able to select a card to "flip it over" and see its other side.
3. If the user flips two matching cards face-up at the same time, the cards will be removed from the game.
4. If the user flips two non-matching cards face-up at the same time, both cards will turn back face down.
5. The user wins when they've matched all the cards!

### Check for Understanding

What are some categories of objects we might want to build when writing the code for a Memory game?

  Did you think of making a `Card` object type? A `Game`?

### Data Structures for "Memory" (Independent Practice)
Let's consider object types Card, Game, and Pair.

Work with a partner to list some properties and methods of cards, the game itself, and a particular pair.

* List the type of each property (number, boolean, `Card`, etc.).
* List the parameters that each method will take.
* Don't forget a constructor!

**Card**
<details><summary>click for examples properties</summary>
  - `faceImage` (string)
  - `isFaceUp` (boolean)
  - `isMatched` (boolean)
  - `flipOver()` (Function - change whether the card is currently face up)
  - `Card(options)` (Function - constructor, create a card based on options like whether it should be a random image or what the image should be)
</details>

**Pair**
<details><summary>click for examples for Pair</summary>
  - `card1` (Card)
  - `card2` (Card)
  - `addCard(someCard)` (Function - add a specific card to the pair)
  - `isMatch()` (Function - check if this pair is a match)
  - `Pair()` (Function - constructor, create an empty pair)
</details>

**Game**
<details><summary>click for examples for Game</summary>
  - `current_guess` (Pair)
  - `cards` ([Card])
  - `reset()` (Function - resets the game!)
  - `randomize()` (Function - creates randomized game)
  - `Game(numCards)` (Function - constructor)
  - `removeCard(card)` (Function - remove this card from the game)
  - `hasWon()` (Function - check if the game has been won!)
  - `celebrate()` (Function - display a win message)
</details>

### User Stories

We build "user stories" as a way to structure the main capabilities of the sites we build. These stories are often phrased as "a user will be able to..." and make sure they discribe how the site will work. Each user story can be broken down into the tasks that will be required to make this functionality possible.

1. A user will be able to see a set of face-down cards.
  * Create HTML structure to display cards on screen (Handlebars?).
  * Ensure that cards start out displayed face-down (in `Card` constructor?).

2. A user will be able to select a card to "flip it over" and see its other side.
  * Add click event listener to cards that:
     - shows the other side of the card (`flipOver`)
     - creates or updates a pair (don't add same card twice though!)
     - checks if the cards in the pair match (`isMatch`)
     - continues according to result (see 3 and 4, below)

3. If the user flips two matching cards face-up at the same time, the cards will be removed from the game.
  * Assuming `isMatch()` gave true for the current pair:
    - set a short timer so the user can see that the cards matched (`setTimeout`), then...
    - replace each card in the pair with a "blank space" image to let user know it's been removed
    - use `off` to take off the click event listener from both cards
    - remove both cards from the game's list of cards

4. If the user flips two non-matching cards face-up at the same time, both cards will turn back face down.
  * Assuming `isMatch()` gave false for the current pair:
    - set a short timer so the user can see the cards (`setTimeout`), then...
    - flip each card in the pair back over so they're face-down

5. The user wins when they've matched all the cards!
  * Every time there is a match, the Game should also check if its cards array is now empty. (`hasWon`)
  * If so, show a win screen (`celebrate`)


###Potential Challenges / Development Questions

1. How to randomize or shuffle card locations at the beginning of the game?
2. How to ensure that all the cards have matches?
3. How to change the image for a card that's face-down, face-up, or matched and removed from game?
4. Is there a way to hide the identity of a card even from users who know how to use the Chrome dev tools?
5. Cool card flip animation?!

### Deliverable

Design user stories, data structures, development stories, and potential challenges for a **racing game** in which two players use the keyboard to control "cars" that race across the screen.

#### Story Point 1:
#### Define what the game basics entail.
* 2 seperate players will race across the screen using the same keyboard & screen. 
* Define what the 2 players are represented with, 2 separate images
* Player 1 will use keystrokes on the left side **A, W, S, and, D**
* Player 2 will use keystrokes on the left side **O, K, L, and, ;**
* Random objects will show up inline for each player that forces a vertical move.
* A number of horizontal moves needs to be established as the finish line for declaring a winner.
* A unix timer should track how long it takes a player to win and then convert it to minutes:seconds for display on screen
* 

### Story Point 2:
#### Define what objects will need to be created to build the game basics. 
* Car/Player Object
* Racetrack Object
* Obstacles Object
* Timer Object
* Current Race Object

### Story Point 3:
#### Define how objects will interact to play the game.
* 2 Car Objects will 

Here are some popular bonus features that would affect your data structure plan:

1. How would you make your player's "cars" use custom images?
2. Can a player type in their name to see custom win messages?
3. Can you enable a reset button to restart the race?
4. How about a win counter that spans across multiple races?
